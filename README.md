# Motion Profile Trajectory Generator

This repository contains a tool for generating motion profile trajectories from spline-based Bezier curves. The generated trajectories can be used in various applications such as robotics and autonomous vehicle navigation.

## Features

- **Spline-Based Bezier Curves**: Utilizes spline-based Bezier curves to create smooth and continuous motion profiles.
- **Trajectory Generation**: Generates motion profiles that can be used for precise control of movement.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Allows customization of parameters to fit specific use cases and requirements.
